# ISClicker
My clicker for the game Idle Slayer, will be updated periodically.

Conditions:
Monitor resolution and in game 1920x1080.
The language in the game is Russian.

To use the clicker you will have to install python and extensions for it (pyautogui, time, keyboard).
Sprite pictures must be stored in the same folder as the ".py" file. To get started, run the ".py" file, after which the script will start.
For it to start working fully, you need to press the "F1" key; to pause the script, hold the "F2" key.

This script can:
Collect rewards from minions.
Go through the chest hunt yourself.
Dash, use rage, collect Pandora's boxes, kill flying and ground enemies.
Complete bonus levels (not working yet).
